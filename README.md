# Game Info

Using as a base the game The Little Explorer from one of our classmates (https://github.com/Windfog-Studios/The-Little-Explorer), we have added the following UI elements in order to make the game more enjoyable an easy to play:

An intro menu, with the buttons for the options of “Play”, “Continue”, “Settings”, “Credits” and “Exit”.
A game HUD that shows the amount of lives that the player has, and the player score.
An in-game menu in which the player can either resume the game or go back to main menu.
